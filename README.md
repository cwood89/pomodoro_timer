## What is the Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro technique was created by Francesco Cirillo as a way to get more done in less time. If used properly you will instantly see results in your productivity.

There are 6 steps in the Pomodoro Technique:

- Choose a task.
- Set a timer for 25 minutes.
- Work in the task until the timer rings.
- When the timer rings, put a check mark on paper.
- Take a 5 min break.
- Every 4 cycles of this take a longer 20 to 30 minute break.

## Future Plans

- Push notifications
- Change timer settings short break/long break
  - Every four pomodoro cycles take a long break.
- Improve UI
- Timer in tab/title - done
- Add todo list
- Total pomodoro counter/goal
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Pomodoro about section
